# Monad Takehome - Progress Tracker

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Recent Transactions Issues Fixed
- [x] **Fixed TypeScript type errors in TRPC client**
  - Removed `AnyRouter` type annotation from `appRouter` declaration
  - Restored proper type inference for all TRPC methods (`getTransactions`, `getBalance`, etc.)
  - All frontend components now have proper type safety

- [x] **Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in getTransactions endpoint**
  - Root cause: `env.DB` was being accessed at module load time
  - Solution: Implemented proxy-based database initialization pattern
  - Database now properly initializes per request in Cloudflare Workers context

- [x] **Database Setup**
  - Applied D1 database migrations locally using `wrangler d1 migrations apply --local DB`
  - Created transactions table with proper indexes
  - Database connection now works correctly in development

- [x] **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Removed unused imports across the codebase
  - Fixed unused parameter warnings
  - Updated biome.json schema version to match CLI
  - Cleaned up linting issues in main application code

## üöß Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority
- [ ] **Test Recent Transactions functionality end-to-end**
  - Verify transaction fetching works for all supported chains
  - Test error handling for API failures
  - Ensure proper loading states and error messages

- [ ] **Implement missing features mentioned in initial commit**
  - [ ] Complete transaction history pagination
  - [ ] Add Figma styling and design tokens
  - [ ] Implement custom wallet connector
  - [ ] Make interface responsive for mobile devices

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **API Rate Limiting & Caching**
  - Implement proper caching for external API calls (Etherscan, CoinGecko)
  - Add rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
  - Consider implementing background job for transaction syncing

- [ ] **Testing & Quality Assurance**
  - Write unit tests for transaction fetching logic
  - Add integration tests for TRPC endpoints
  - Set up end-to-end testing for critical user flows

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Optimize transaction list virtualization
  - Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens
  - Add error boundaries for better error handling

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Developer Experience**
  - Add proper TypeScript types for environment variables
  - Improve error messages and debugging
  - Add development documentation

- [ ] **Production Readiness**
  - Set up proper environment configuration
  - Configure production database migrations
  - Add monitoring and alerting

## üêõ Known Issues

### Linting Warnings (Non-blocking)
- Auto-generated files in `apps/docs/.astro/` contain linting warnings
- Wrangler generated files have unused import warnings
- These don't affect functionality but should be addressed for clean builds

### Environment Variables
- Some optional environment variables may not be properly configured
- Consider adding validation for required environment variables

## üìù Technical Notes

### Database Architecture
- Using Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) for transaction storage
- Implemented efficient indexing for common queries
- Database initialization uses proxy pattern for Cloudflare Workers compatibility

### API Integration
- Etherscan API integration for transaction fetching
- CoinGecko API for price data
- Both have fallback mechanisms for API failures

### Frontend Architecture
- TRPC for type-safe API calls
- React Query for caching and state management
- Tanstack Virtual for efficient large list rendering

## üéØ Success Criteria

The Recent Transactions feature should:
- [x] Load without TypeScript errors
- [x] Start server without 500 errors
- [ ] Display transactions from all supported networks
- [ ] Handle loading states gracefully
- [ ] Show appropriate error messages when APIs fail
- [ ] Support pagination for large transaction lists
- [ ] Be responsive across different screen sizes
